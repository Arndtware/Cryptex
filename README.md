# Cryptex
A cryptex designed by me, Joe Arndt, completely open source using "The Unlicense"

# What is this and why did I make it?
A cryptex is simply a cylindrical safe that uses rotating rings to form a combination, once set correctly it pulls apart to reveal an internal chamber. See the following link for additional information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptex

This is my own custom design. While I spent a lot of time reading about and reviewing other designs online, I couldn't find exactly what I wanted. My main requirements are: 1) changeable combination, 2) metal construction, 3) open source/free plans. I found plenty of designs out there, but none that met all my requirements, so I designed my own. The current design only has 5 rings with 10 faces, however I don't see a reason why the dimensions cannot be adjusted without using the same design principles. The unique parts of this design are primarily the use of Ball Plungers to "lock" the rings as they rotate, and the Spacer/Ring/Code Sleeve design that allows them to fit together in an interchangeable way.

# Part list
* 01 Housing
* 01 Core
* 05 Rings
* 05 Code Sleeves
* 06 Spacers
* 10 Ball Plungers ()(http://www.springandballplungers.com/-c-50_55_160.html)
* 12 Grub Screws (Cone-point, M2x3mm) (https://www.amazon.com/20pcs-STAINLESS-SCREWS-SOCKET-DIN914/dp/B0176N4BC6)

# Assembly
1. To assemble the cryptex start with the Housing. Slide the first Spacer over the Housing being sure to align the keyway on both pieces. Once it is all the way down, install 2 Grub Screws into the Spacer, the screws should protrude on the inside of the Spacer, resting in the dimples in the Housing, locking it in place.
2. Next slide the first Ring over the Housing, being sure the smooth side is touching the Spacer, leaving the 10 notches exposed. Once it is against the Spacer, install 2 Ball Plungers in the ring. The spring-loaded ball should protrude on the inside of the ring, and should rest in the dimples in the Housing. This will hold the ring in place, but still allow rotation around the Housing.
3. Now it is time to install the Code Sleeve. The Code Sleeve has 10 ribs on the inside, which will fit into the notches on the Ring. It is designed so that any of the 10 faces of the Code Sleeve can be set or changed for a custom combination. The face aligned opposite of the keyway on the Ring is what the combination will use.
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until the last Spacer is installed.
5. The cryptex is now assembled, and the Core can be inserted and locked into place.

# WARNING
I am not an engineer, designer, machinist, or manufacturer. My design could be perfect, or, more likely, it could have many flaws making it an unusable piece of garbage. I make no promises in regards to accuracy or correctness of design. Feel free to download the files and use them, or modify them, or whatever. If you think you can improve my design, I would love to know, although you are not required to do so per "The Unlicense". And although not required, I would recommend you maintain "The Unlicense" if you do change this, in the spirit of open source.
